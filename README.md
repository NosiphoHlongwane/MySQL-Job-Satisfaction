## Analysis
Analysis

**Data Cleaning (Excel)**
- Removed duplicate records to ensure accuracy.
- Standardised categorical fields (e.g., gender, education level, commute mode).
- Created calculated fields (e.g., age_group) for grouped analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (MySQL)**
-  descriptive statistics (average age, sleep hours).
- Analysed distributions by gender, education level, and department.
- Investigated relationships between:
- Job satisfaction and stress levels
- Sleep hours and satisfaction
- Workload and stress
- Commute mode and satisfaction by job level
- Age group and satisfaction by department

**Data Visualisation (Power BI)**
- Built interactive dashboards to visualise:
- Job satisfaction across demographics
- Impact of sleep, stress, and commute
- Trends by department and education

## Results
- Stress and workload: High stress and heavy workloads strongly linked to low job satisfaction.
- Sleep hours: Employees with longer sleep durations reported higher satisfaction.
- Age & education: Younger employees and those with higher education levels showed varied satisfaction depending on department and commute mode.
- Commute: Long or stressful commutes reduced satisfaction significantly.

## Recommendation
- Implement wellness programs to reduce stress and encourage healthy sleep habits.
- Distribute workloads fairly to prevent burnout.
- Offer flexible commuting or remote work options.
- Tailor HR strategies by age group, education, and department trends.
